# CaseReportRepo

This repo contains the relevant code for reproducing the results of the paper 
STATE-DEPENDENT RESPONSES TO INTRACRANIAL BRAIN STIMULATION IN DEPRESSION: A CASE REPORT. 
Figures will also be generated within the jupyter-notebooks. A requirements.txt file is included to 
ensure stability across runs. It is recommended that users create a virtual environment to run these notebooks. 
For questions about the code, data processing or figure rendering, please email ghassan.makhoul@ucsf.edu.
